# Evo: Environmental evolution simulation for agent-based models.
Evo is an ongoing personal project born from a desire to explore my interest in wildlife and ecology through the lens of computer science. By combining the field of artificial intelligence with ecological simulation, I have recreated predator-prey interaction in a two-dimensional space. This project aims to create an accurate representation of a natural environment while allowing certain parameters to be changed, resulting in an experiment which allows us to see how modifying certain conditions in a natural environment may affect the creatures within it.

This project is written in Python using the Mesa framework.

## Instructions
To run the model, download the files off github to your local computer. Ensure you have the software requirements listed in `requirements.txt`. Run the following command in the directory containing the files:
`solara run app.py`. 


## Future Iterations:
- Switch to representing the environment using continuous space
- Implement vision cones for predators and prey instead of a radius
- Transfer off of Mesa into Godot or Unity engine for a more visually appealing graphic and greater control over environmental factors.
