# Evo: Environmental evolution simulation for agent-based models.
This project is written in Python using the Mesa framework.

## Instructions
To run the model, download the files off github to your local computer. Ensure you have the software requirements listed in `requirements.txt`. Run the following command in the directory containing the files:
`solara run app.py`. 


## Future Objectives:
- Switch to representing the environment using continuous space
- Implement vision cones for predators and prey instead of a radius
- Transfer off of Mesa into Godot or Unity engine for a more visually appealing graphic and greater control over environmental factors.
